 * Library functions to support web app clients
 */

/*
* The basic decision tree supported by installed web apps is:
*
* Is this app installed in the current client?
*   If not, and this is a problem, guide the user to a preview, install flow, etc.
*   If it's not a problem, carry on, nothing to see here.
* 
* Does the manifest that the client is using match the
* app's most-current manifest?
*   If not, and if this is a problem, update the manifest.
*   (Note that the security policy of the client may require confirmation for some updates)
*
* If the app cares about receipts (for single-sign-on or proof-of-purchase),
* does the app have an installed receipt?
*   If not, and this is a problem, guide the user to a recovery flow.  
*   (For single signon, this could be just fine; for proof-of-purchase,
*   this requires more work; are we dealing with an upgrade from a free
*   app to a paid app?  may need to guide the user back to the marketplace)
*  
* Once the receipt is in-hand, is it well-formed?
*   If not, this is an error.
*
* If the receipt has a user identity in it, does the app want to
* verify the identity?
*   If so, use navigator.id to get an assertion proving the identity.
*   The assertion will then need to be sent to the server for proofing.
*
* Does the app want to verify the receipt?
*   Locally?  If so, need the public key from the receipt issuer.  If
*      the client doesn't support secure crypto, this is not all that real.
*   At the receipt issuer?  Need to hit the verifyURL.
*   At the server?  Need to send the receipt to the server for proofing.
*
* If the user identity and the receipt are both to be verified at the server,
* it would be performant to combine those uploads into a single transaction.
* This is a nice-to-have.

/*
* options is an object which optionally contains:
*   - checkManifest: if defined, the manifest is compared to the manifest provided in
*        this field; mismatches will cause the onManifestOutOfDate method to run.
*        comparison is for JavaScript object equality, not string match.  if no
*        onManifestOutOfDate is provided, a mismatched manifest will cause a failure.
*   - checkReceipt: if true, the receipt flow is followed
*   - checkIdentity: if true, the identity verification flow is followed
*        (ignored unless checkReceipt is true)
*   - verifyURL: if defined (as a relative path on my server), the receipt and
*         optional identity assertion will be POSTed to this URL for verification.
*         the server must return XXX.
* 
* behavior is an object which optionally contains the following named functions:
*
*   - onNotInstalled: called if the current app is not installed
*           return value is ignored.
*   - onManifestOutOfDate: called if checkManifest is true and the manifest isn't current
*           if the function returns TRUE, checking continues
*           if the function returns FALSE, processing completes.
*   - onNoReceipt: called if checkReceipt was true and no receipt is found
*   - onMalformedReceipt: called if checkReceipt was true, and a receipt is found but is malformed
*   - onVerifyReceipt: called with arguments (receipt, [ identityAssertion ]).
*           identityAssertion will be sent only if checkIdentity was true.
*   - onInvalidReceipt: called with string argument "invalid", "refunded", "revoked"
*   - onInvalidIdentity: called with XXX?
*   - onFailure: called when verifyURL returns an error
*   - onSuccess: called when all the checks and verify steps have completed successfully.
